# What is Welfare:
Open source web application which aims to protect and guide tourists, foreigners, and citizens as well to safe neighborhoods, areas, and directions in a particular city, through a map marked with colored areas that show the extent of the danger of the area, in addition to a feature that allows you to know the type of danger or crimes that have previously been recorded in that marked area, and a warning The user will receive notifications and messages if he accesses this area via the GPS positioning feature. 
<br />
<br />
These areas are identified and marked by legal organizations (such as the police station), which helps them identify the areas of people at risk and quickly obtain information from messages, complaints, and notifications of users if they encounter a specific problem, and thus determine the nearest policeman or intervention team to the place The intention is to intervene quickly to ensure the safety of people.
